The goal of {inphr} is to provide a set of functions for performing null
hypothesis testing on samples of persistence diagrams using the theory of
permutations. Currently, only two-sample testing is implemented. Inputs can be
either samples of persistence diagrams themselves or vectorizations. In the
former case, they are embedded in a metric space using either the Bottleneck or
Wasserstein distance. In the former case, persistence data becomes functional
data and inference is performed using tools available in the
[{fdatest}](https://permaverse.github.io/fdatest/) package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of inphr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tdaverse/inphr")
```

## Example

Let us start by loading the package:

```{r}
library(inphr)
```

The package contains three sets of persistence diagrams, which can be used for
testing. They are available in the package as `trefoils1`, `trefoils2`, and
`archspirals`. The first two sets contain persistence diagrams computed from
noisy samples of trefoil knots, while the third set contains persistence
diagrams computed from noisy samples of 2-armed Archimedean spirals. Each set
contains 24 persistence diagrams, each computed from a sample of 120 points
sampled from the respective shape, with Gaussian noise added (standard
deviation = 0.05). The persistence diagrams were computed using the
[`TDA::ripsDiag()`] function with a maximum scale of 6 and up to dimension 2.
You can use the `two_sample_test()` function to perform a two-sample test on
these persistence diagrams. For example, to test whether the first 5
persistence diagrams from the first set are significantly different from the
first 5 persistence diagrams from the second set, you can run:

```{r}
two_sample_test(trefoils1[1:5], trefoils2[1:5], B = 100L)
```

To test whether the first 5 persistence diagrams from the first set are
significantly different from the first 5 persistence diagrams from the third
set, you can run:

```{r}
two_sample_test(trefoils1[1:5], archspirals[1:5], B = 100L)
```

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to open an issue or a pull request
if you have any suggestions or improvements. The package is still in its early
stages, so any feedback is appreciated.
