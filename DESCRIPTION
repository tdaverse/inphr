Description: A set of functions for performing null hypothesis testing on
    samples of persistence diagrams using the theory of permutations. Currently,
    only two-sample testing is implemented. Inputs can be either samples of
    persistence diagrams themselves or vectorizations. In the former case, they
    are embedded in a metric space using either the Bottleneck or Wasserstein
    distance. In the former case, persistence data becomes functional data and
    inference is performed using tools available in the 'fdatest' package.
